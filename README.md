**Date:** June 2024-July 2024

## Project Overview

This project uses Logistic Regression to predict whether a credit card holder is likely to default on their payments. The analysis involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature scaling, model training, and evaluation.

## Dataset

**Source:**  
The dataset is obtained from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Credit Card Default Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/default+of+credit+card+clients).

**Features:**
- `LIMIT`: Amount of credit (in dollars)
- `SEX`: Gender of the credit card holder (1 = male, 2 = female)
- `EDUCATION`: Educational level (1 = graduate school, 2 = university, 3 = high school, 4 = other)
- `MARRIAGE`: Marital status (1 = married, 2 = single, 3 = others)
- `AGE`: Age of the credit card holder (in years)
- `PAY_0` to `PAY_6`: History of past payment (range: -1 to 9)
- `BILL_AMT1` to `BILL_AMT6`: Bill statement amount for the past 6 months
- `PAY_AMT1` to `PAY_AMT6`: Amount of previous payments for the past 6 months
- `default_payment_next_month`: Target variable (1 = default, 0 = no default)

## Requirements

- **Python Version:** 3.x
- **Libraries:**
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - scikit-learn

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

    ```bash
    cd <project_directory>
    ```

3. **Install Required Libraries:**

    ```bash
    pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
    ```

## How to Run the Code

1. **Download the Dataset:**

   Place the dataset file (`creditcard.ipynb (df).csv`) in the project directory.

2. **Execute the Script (Notebook in this case):**

   Run the Python script (notebook in this case) to perform the analysis:

    ```bash
    python <script_name>.py
    ```

## Analysis Details

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
- Box plots to visualize feature distributions.
- Histograms to show the distribution of features.
- Correlation heatmap to identify feature relationships.

**Feature Scaling:**
- The `AGE` feature is scaled using `StandardScaler`.

**Model Training and Evaluation:**
- Logistic Regression is used to predict default status.
- Evaluation metrics include accuracy scores and ROC curves.

**Prediction:**
- Example of predicting default status for a specific case.

## Visuals

The following visuals are included in the project (pyhton notebook):
- Box Plots
- Scaled AGE Box Plot
- Histograms
- Correlation Matrix Heatmap
- Training and Testing Data Evaluation Scatter Plots
- ROC Curves

## Results

- **Training Accuracy:** 0.778125
- **Testing Accuracy:** 0.7811666666666667

**Example Prediction:**
- For a specific customer, the prediction is: [Predicted Default Status]
